## 🚀 Method 1: GitHub Web Interface (Recommended for Large Repositories)

### Step 1: Create New Repository on GitHub
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the **"+"** icon in the top right corner
3. Select **"New repository"**
4. Fill in repository details:
   - **Repository name**: `more-than-friends`
   - **Description**: `A beautiful, interactive digital love story website showcasing the journey of Brian and Rose from friendship to forever love.`
   - **Visibility**: Choose Public or Private
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
5. Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 2: Upload via GitHub Web Interface
Since the repository is 227MB with many image files, use GitHub's web upload:

1. On your new repository page, click **"uploading an existing file"**
2. Create a ZIP file of your project:
   ```bash
   cd /home/ubuntu/more-than-friends-github
   zip -r more-than-friends.zip . -x ".git/*"
   ```
3. Upload the ZIP file through GitHub's interface
4. GitHub will extract and commit the files automatically

## 🖥️ Method 2: Command Line Upload (Alternative)

### Step 1: Add Remote Origin
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/more-than-friends-github
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/more-than-friends.git
```

### Step 2: Push to GitHub
```bash
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Note**: Due to the 227MB size, this may take some time and could hit GitHub's file size limits. The web interface method is recommended.
