"This is inedible," I said, laughing.

"Agreed. Pizza?" he offered without missing a beat.

An hour later, we were sitting cross-legged on the floor with a delivery box between us, both laughing so hard my cheeks hurt. It was one of those nights where the failure was better than the plan.`,

I let her talk about him — the music he'd loved, the way he'd made her laugh in lectures.

At one point, she went silent. I said softly, "It's okay if you just want me here, even without words."

We stayed on the line like that for almost half an hour before she whispered, "Thank you for holding space for him with me."`,

In front of one black-and-white portrait, he said, "This one looks like it's keeping a secret." I smiled because I'd been thinking the same thing.

We stopped for coffee in the museum café, talking about the art we'd seen. It felt easy, like the hours had passed without us noticing.`,

That evening, she texted: It went well. Couldn't have done it without you.

When I opened my apartment door that evening, he was standing there with a cake, two mugs, and a small wrapped box. "Figured you shouldn't spend it alone," he said.

We ate cake on my sofa, the candles still faintly warm on the plate. When I opened the box, it was a book by my favourite author — signed.

I didn't say much, but I think my smile told him everything.`,

We talked about nothing important — a movie she'd seen, the way the city sounded different in winter. At one point, she looped her arm through mine to steady herself on an icy patch.

The touch stayed, unremarked on, for the rest of the walk.`,

I ranted for a full ten minutes before stopping to catch my breath. He just nodded, letting me get it out, and then asked, "Want me to offer solutions or just agree with you right now?"

That made me laugh, the kind that untangles knots in your chest. "Just agree," I said. And he did.`,

We sat in the same corner booth, ordered the same coffee, and read parts of the newspaper aloud to each other. Sometimes we lingered for hours, not because we had to, but because neither of us wanted to leave yet.`,

When we stood to leave, I realized I felt lighter than I had that morning. She hadn't tried to fix anything, just made sure I didn't carry it alone.`,

We ended up on the coast, eating fish and chips on a windy pier. She took photos of the gulls and the ocean spray, insisting I be in a few of them.

"I just don't see why you wouldn't push harder," I said.

He frowned. "And I don't see why you think you know all the variables."

We both went quiet after that. The conversation ended politely, but the warmth we usually had didn't return that night.`,

He picked up on the second ring. "Rose?" His voice was steady, not hurried, like he'd already decided he was going to give me as much time as I needed.

"My uncle's gone," I said, and my voice cracked on the last word.

"I'm coming over," he said simply. Not Do you want me to come? — just a certainty, as though the answer was already yes.

When he arrived, he didn't knock loudly, just stepped in and set two steaming mugs on the coffee table. One was my favourite tea, the one I'd told him years ago I only drank when I needed comfort.

We sat on the sofa, both cradling our cups. I told him stories — some funny, some sad — about my uncle. The one about him dancing badly at my cousin's wedding made me laugh in a way that startled me. The one about him telling me, "Don't let your work steal your joy," made me cry harder.

At some point, my hand dropped to my side, and his found it. Not a quick squeeze, but a steady, grounding hold that said, I'm not going anywhere.

"I don't want us to lose this again," I whispered.

He turned toward me fully then, his expression fierce in its quiet way. "We won't, Rose. Not again."

Something shifted in that moment — as if the months of distance had been burned away and what remained was stronger, more deliberate. I felt it settle in my chest: this wasn't just friendship anymore, not in the ordinary sense. It was a choice we'd both made, right there, without saying the words.`,

At one point, her eyes filled, and I instinctively reached across the table, palm up. She didn't hesitate. Her fingers slid into mine, and we stayed like that until the server brought the bill.`,
