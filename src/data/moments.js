"Hey, you're in the wrong section," I said.

She smiled without looking up. "Maybe I'm just waiting for you to recommend something."

I slid a worn Miles Davis record toward her. "Sunday mornings at my dad's house," I explained.

We stood at the listening station, sharing a single set of headphones. Her hair brushed my cheek, and instead of pulling back, I let the moment stay. When the track ended, she glanced at me, eyes softer than before.

"You always bring me something new," she said. And it felt like she meant more than music.`,

"You didn't have to come all this way," I said.

"I wanted to see you here," he replied. "It's where you shine."

I walked him through the office. Watching him interact with my team — asking questions, remembering names — reminded me why people had followed him so willingly.

In my office, he set a small bag on my desk. "Your favourite green tea. I figured you could use it today."

I poured us both cups. Our knees bumped under the desk, and neither of us moved them.`,

"You've made it cozy," she said, scanning the bookshelves.

"It's where I can breathe," I replied.

Her eyes landed on the sheet music by the piano. "Play me something."

I played, fingers finding the melody I'd been working on. She set her tea down and came closer, leaning on the edge of the piano.

"That's beautiful," she said. "What's it called?"

"It doesn't have a name yet."

She hummed along to the last few bars. "It sounds like Sunday afternoon."`,

"Did I wake you?" I asked.

"No," he said, though I could tell he'd been close. "What's going on?"

"Nothing, really. Just... needed to talk to someone who knows me."

We stayed on the line for an hour, talking about everything and nothing. When I finally hung up, I realized I'd been holding my breath for most of the day, and this was the first time I'd exhaled.`,

She looked up, surprised, then stepped into me. Not the quick, polite hug we'd shared before, but something full and real. Her arms wrapped around me, and I felt her cheek against my chest.

We stayed like that longer than necessary, neither of us in a hurry to let go.

He grinned. "What does the winner get?"

"Bragging rights. And the loser buys coffee next time."

We split up, browsing the narrow aisles. I found a worn paperback I knew he'd love and tucked a pressed maple leaf between the pages as a bookmark.

When we reconvened, he handed me a book I'd mentioned wanting to read months ago. Of course he'd remembered.

"I think we both won," I said.`,

She set up across from me, laptop open, papers spread. We worked in comfortable silence, the kind that felt productive rather than awkward.

Every so often, I'd catch her looking up, thinking, and I'd pretend to be absorbed in my own work. But I liked having her there, liked the way she made the space feel less solitary.

"I haven't laughed like that in months," I told him as we walked to our cars afterward.

"Chicken noodle soup," I said, holding up the bag. "My mom's recipe."

We sat at her kitchen table, and she told me about her week while we ate. There was something about seeing her in her own space, comfortable and unguarded, that made me want to stay longer than I should have.`,

I should have known she'd be competitive about grocery shopping. She darted between aisles while I took a more methodical approach.

She was already at checkout when I arrived, grinning smugly.

"What do I win?" she asked.

"Pastries," I said, grabbing a box from the bakery section. "And my eternal respect."

He sat beside me, occasionally nudging my knee with his, not saying much. Just being there.

"I needed this," I said eventually.

"What did you think?" she asked when the credits rolled.

We repotted it together, dirt scattered across the tiles. At one point, I flicked a little soil at him, and he brushed it off with exaggerated offense.

"There," he said, stepping back to admire our work. "Good as new."

The plant did survive. So did the memory of his hands covered in dirt, working to save something I cared about.`,

He frowned. "And I don't see why you think you know all the variables."

The words hung between us, sharper than either of us had intended. We finished our coffee politely, but the warmth we usually shared didn't return that day.

It was our first real disagreement, and it left me unsettled.`,

He picked up on the second ring. "Claire?"

His voice was steady, not hurried, like he'd already decided he was going to give me as much time as I needed.

"My uncle's gone," I said, and my voice cracked on the last word.

"I'm coming over," he said simply. Not Do you want me to come? — just a certainty, as though the answer was already yes.

When he arrived, he didn't knock loudly, just stepped in and set two steaming mugs on the coffee table. One was my favourite tea, the one I'd told him years ago I only drank when I needed comfort.

We sat on the sofa, both cradling our cups. I told him stories — some funny, some sad — about my uncle. The one about him dancing badly at my cousin's wedding made me laugh in a way that startled me. The one about him telling me, "Don't let your work steal your joy," made me cry harder.

At some point, my hand dropped to my side, and his found it. Not a quick squeeze, but a steady, grounding hold that said, I'm not going anywhere.

"I don't want us to lose this again," I whispered.

He turned toward me fully then, his expression fierce in its quiet way. "We won't, Claire. Not again."

Something shifted in that moment — as if the months of distance had been burned away and what remained was stronger, more deliberate. I felt it settle in my chest: this wasn't just friendship anymore, not in the ordinary sense. It was a choice we'd both made, right there, without saying the words.`,
