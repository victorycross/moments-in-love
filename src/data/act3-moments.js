He joined in, equally off-key, until we were both laughing too hard to keep going. When the song ended, he glanced over, grinning. "I like the sound of you happy."

It was such a simple thing, but I carried it with me for days.`,

The woman's gratitude was obvious, but it was the casual, unshowy way Rose just smiled and wished her a good day that struck me. I'd always known she was kind, but in that moment, it felt like I was seeing the full weight of her heart.`,

He took off his jacket and draped it over my shoulders, his shirt clinging in the downpour. I caught myself memorizing the shape of that moment — the way he looked at me like I wasn't just a friend standing in the rain, but something more.`,

Her laughter was unrestrained, head thrown back, eyes bright. It felt like watching sunlight return to a room after days of rain.`,

I looked up at him, and there was no joke in his eyes, no small talk. Just… presence. The kind that feels like a promise, even if no one says anything.`,

"Rough morning?" I asked.

"Nothing I can't handle," he said, brushing it off and steering the conversation toward my week.

Halfway through my story about a client, I noticed his coffee sitting untouched, his fingers gripping the mug like it was keeping him upright.

"You don't have to be here if you're not okay," I told him.

He shook his head. "I promised you breakfast." But I could tell the effort it took to be present was costing him more than he'd admit.`,

I told her the truth before I could stop myself: "I'm glad I was there, but Rose… I'm running on empty."

There was a pause. "Empty how?" she asked gently.

"Like I've been pouring into everyone else for so long that there's nothing left for me. Like I'm just… holding the pieces together until they finally give way." My voice caught.

"You can't keep doing that," she said. "Not with me. I'd rather you came to me broken than not at all."

Her words hit hard. I'd always thought being strong for her meant hiding the cracks. That night, I realized she'd been asking to see them all along.`,

But halfway through a story, his voice caught on a reply. He stopped walking.

When I turned, his eyes were wet. "Sorry," he muttered, looking down. "It's just… I'm so tired, Rose. I don't know how much more I've got in me."

The cold stung my face as I stepped closer. "Then let me carry some of it." He didn't answer, but he didn't move away either.`,

I listened that night. The songs weren't about sadness exactly — more about breathing space. I sat there with the music in my ears, realizing how little of that I'd allowed myself.

When it ended, I pressed play again.`,

Then, mid-conversation, his eyes drifted to a box on the shelf. I saw something shift in his face.

"What's in there?" I asked gently.

He hesitated. "Photos." His voice was already thinner than before. "Some I've been avoiding."

He stood, brought the box over, and began flipping through them. The first few made him smile faintly. Then came one from his first marriage.

It was like watching him deflate in front of me. "That guy thought he was enough if he just gave everything he had," he whispered. "And it still wasn't enough."

The fork in my hand was forgotten. "Brian—"

But the words broke him. His hands went to his face, shoulders shaking.`,

Then her arms were around me. Not a polite hug, but a steady, grounding hold that made it impossible to keep pretending.

She didn't say It's okay. She didn't tell me to stop. She just held on, one hand at the back of my head, the other across my shoulders, as if she had no intention of letting go until I found air again.

When I finally pulled back, my face was a mess and I couldn't meet her eyes. She tilted her head until I did. "You never have to go through that alone again," she said quietly.

And for the first time in a long while, I believed someone meant it.`,

We talked about nothing and everything — childhood pets, songs we still remembered the lyrics to, how the rain sounded different at night.

Just before we hung up, he said softly, "It's easier to breathe when you're on the line."`,

It wasn't dramatic. She didn't make it a declaration. But it landed in the center of me, solid and unshakable.`,

When I asked, she told me about her grandfather's death — how she'd been too busy with work to visit in the weeks before.

"How could I not? You kept laughing at me the whole time," I said, standing as if on instinct.

She held out her hand. "Show me if you've gotten any better."

I took it, and this time there was no instructor, no crowded studio, just the soft light of her apartment. We moved slowly, almost swaying more than dancing, her hand resting lightly in mine, my other hand finding the curve of her waist.

It wasn't like that first time — all jokes and missteps. This was unhurried, quieter, the kind of moment where the air feels heavier in a way you both notice but don't name.

Outside my building, I hugged him goodnight — longer than usual. When I pulled back, he was still close, his hand resting at my lower back.

"You should come up," I said, voice casual but eyes holding his. "Just for one more drink."

In my apartment, I poured two glasses, and we sat on the sofa, shoulders pressed together. At one point, my head tipped against his — maybe because of the wine, maybe not. Neither of us moved for a long time.

When I finally lifted my head to look at him, his gaze lingered on my mouth before meeting my eyes again. I don't know which of us leaned in first, but the kiss was soft, slow, and unhurried — the kind where neither person is in a rush to pull away.

When it broke, we just sat there for a moment, our foreheads still touching, both of us quietly aware that something had shifted for good.`,
