"Hey, you're in the wrong section," I said.

She smiled without looking up. "Maybe I'm just waiting for you to recommend something."

I slid a worn Miles Davis record toward her. "Sunday mornings at my dad's house," I explained.

We stood at the listening station, sharing a single set of headphones. Her hair brushed my cheek, and instead of pulling back, I let the moment stay. When the track ended, she glanced at me, eyes softer than before.

"You always bring me something new," she said. And it felt like she meant more than music.`,

"You didn't have to come all this way," I said.

"I wanted to see you here," he replied. "It's where you shine."

I walked him through the office. Watching him interact with my team — asking questions, remembering names — reminded me why people had followed him so willingly.

In my office, he set a small bag on my desk. "Your favourite green tea. I figured you could use it today."

I poured us both cups. Our knees bumped under the desk, and neither of us moved them.`,

"You've made it cozy," she said, scanning the bookshelves.

"It's where I can breathe," I replied.

Her eyes landed on the sheet music by the piano. "Play me something."

I played, fingers finding the melody I'd been working on. She set her tea down and came closer, leaning on the edge of the piano.

"That's you," she said quietly. Her hand came to rest briefly on my shoulder — warm, grounding.

We let the pause stretch before either of us spoke again.`,

"Thought it would be fun," he grinned. "And you'd be better at it than me."

By the third song, we'd stopped worrying about the moves. During a spin gone wrong, I bumped into him and grabbed his hands to steady myself.

His fingers stayed laced with mine even after we'd found our balance.

As the class ended, we lingered near the door. "We're not winning any competitions," I said.

"No," he replied, squeezing my hand, "but I'd dance with you again."`,

We walked slowly, shoulders brushing now and then. At one corner, a car splashed through a puddle, spraying my leg. She laughed so hard she grabbed my arm for balance. Her hand stayed there even as the streetlamps flicked on in the misty evening.

When we reached her hotel, I hesitated, not ready to say goodbye. She seemed to feel it too.

"Come in for tea," she said. In the warm glow of the lobby, our conversation dropped into softer tones, and I realized I was matching the pace of my voice to the rhythm of her breathing.`,

At a knitwear booth, I tried on a hat. He reached forward, adjusting it gently so it sat just right. His hands were warm against my hair, lingering just a moment longer than needed.

Later, weaving through the crowd, he reached for my hand. At first, I thought it was to guide me, but even after we found a clear path, his hand stayed in mine until the station came into view.`,

We sat together on the sofa, shoulders touching as we flipped through old pictures. She laughed at my 90s hair, and I teased her about a childhood photo where she was frowning at the camera.

Halfway through, she rested her head lightly on my shoulder. The scent of her hair, the simple weight of her leaning there — it was as if the room had drawn smaller around us. Neither of us moved until the teapot whistled from the kitchen.`,

When the air cooled further, I shifted toward him. His arm came around me without hesitation, his thumb tracing slow circles along my sleeve. We didn't talk much, just listened to the soft lap of water and the occasional call of a loon. It felt like the kind of silence you only share with someone you trust completely.`,

"You've changed since we first met," she said. "You're calmer now. More… sure of yourself."

I looked at her for a long moment before answering. "That's because of people who've believed in me." I didn't name her, but her eyes softened in a way that told me she knew.

When the timer went off for the oven, she stepped closer to reach it, her arm brushing mine. She didn't step back right away.`,

"I think," I began, but stopped, my voice catching.

He squeezed my hand gently. "What?"

I shook my head and smiled. "I'll tell you another time."

The moment passed, but the warmth of his hand in mine stayed with me long after we left.`,

We moved easily through the aisles, trading small jokes, tasting cheese samples. When I reached for a jar on the top shelf, she stepped in closer than necessary, her hand resting lightly on my back for balance.

At the checkout, we packed the bags together without speaking much. There was a quiet sense of being a team, even in something as simple as groceries.`,

We walked with his arm around me, tucked under the coat, our steps matched to keep the fabric from slipping. It was warm there, his hand resting gently at my waist.

When we reached my building, I turned to thank him. For a moment, we didn't move — both of us holding the pause just a little too long before stepping back.`,

Somewhere after Kingston, her head drifted onto my shoulder. I stayed still, hardly daring to breathe too deeply, just letting her weight settle there.

When she stirred awake near the city, she looked up and smiled. "You make a good pillow," she said, and though she meant it lightly, I felt the warmth of it long after we stepped onto the platform.`,

He didn't sound sleepy, just present. We talked for over an hour — about work, about small frustrations, about the book I was reading. At one point, there was a long silence.

"You still there?" I asked.

"Yeah," he said quietly. "Just listening to you."

Something shifted in me then, hearing the way he said it.`,

When we reached her car, she turned and stepped forward into me — no half-measure, no polite pat on the back. Her arms wrapped fully around me, her cheek against my chest.

I held her, feeling the slow exhale she let out. She didn't rush to let go, and when she finally did, her eyes lingered on mine before she slipped into the driver's seat.`,

We wandered separately, occasionally catching sight of each other between shelves. He showed up at the counter with a worn paperback of short stories. "Something about this reminded me of you," he said.

When I opened it later, a pressed maple leaf fell out. I never asked if he'd put it there — some part of me wanted to believe it had just been waiting for us to find.`,

Walking out, my cheeks still hurt from smiling. "We need to do this again," I told him. And I meant it.`,
