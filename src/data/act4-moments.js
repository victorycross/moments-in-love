Then, halfway through coffee, she reached across the table and brushed her fingers against mine. It was small, but it said, I remember too."

This time, when her head rested on my chest, my arm came around her without thought. We stayed like that until well past midnight."

    content: "It was raining, and she'd asked me to stay over rather than drive home. We ended up in her bedroom, sitting on the edge of the bed, talking softly. The conversation slowed, and she reached for my hand, threading her fingers through mine. The kiss that followed was deeper than before, lingering, until we both leaned back onto the bed. There was no rush, no sense of performance — just the slow, certain awareness that we were finally letting ourselves cross into something we'd both been moving toward for a long time."

When he stirred, his smile was slow, unguarded. \"Morning,\" he murmured, brushing his lips across my shoulder before kissing me properly — unhurried, gentle at first, then deeper, as though the day could wait a little longer for us."

The clothes came off slowly, deliberately, each touch a reminder of the new territory we'd claimed. After, we stayed wrapped in the same blanket, our legs tangled, sharing quiet jokes in the glow of the lamp."

When he leaned in to kiss me, it deepened almost immediately, our bodies shifting together in a familiar rhythm now. The rest of the evening blurred into the feel of his hands, the warmth of his breath against my neck, and the sound of our laughter between kisses — until the sofa felt less like a piece of furniture and more like our own private world."

Her laugh was soft, but her voice turned warmer. \"Come over and find out.\" I did — and within minutes, we were in her bedroom, rediscovering the edges of each other in the hush of the dark."

He smiled, brushing his thumb along my jaw. \"If I do, I might not leave.\" The kiss that followed was long and slow, the kind that promises more — and when he did come up, we both knew it wouldn't be for just one more drink."

    content: "Sunlight spilled across his bare chest as I traced my fingers over the lines of muscle and the faint scars I'd never noticed before. He kept his eyes on me, smiling faintly as if memorizing my face. When I leaned down to kiss him, his hands slid to my hips under the sheet, pulling me closer until we were pressed skin to skin again. The world outside felt like it could wait forever."

    content: "The rain had been falling all afternoon, drumming softly against the windows. She came out of the shower wrapped in a towel, her hair damp, drops sliding down her collarbone. I reached for her without thinking, pulling her onto my lap, the towel loosening between us. The kiss deepened, slow at first, then with the kind of hunger that makes time slip. When we finally pulled away, the towel was on the floor, and she was smiling against my mouth."

I ran my hand along his chest, feeling the steady beat of his heart. \"You are enough,\" I whispered, kissing the place just above it. He closed his eyes, exhaling like he'd been holding that breath for years."

She was perched on the counter, legs wrapped loosely around my waist as I kissed her neck. Her laugh was soft, almost a purr, her hands sliding into my hair. It was playful, teasing, but the warmth between us was unmistakable — a mix of comfort and want that kept me close even after the coffee was made."

    content: "I'd been waiting for him to answer for over an hour. We'd talked earlier about making dinner together, but as the clock crept past seven, my frustration grew. When he finally called back, his voice was warm, apologetic — he'd gotten caught up helping a colleague with a late-night issue. I wanted to forgive him instantly, but instead I found myself saying, \"You always put yourself last, Brian. And by extension… me.\" The silence on the line felt heavier than either of us expected."

I told myself it was to give her space, but the truth was, her words had hit deeper than I wanted to admit. She was right — I did this in my marriage too, always overextending, coming home with nothing left to give. Lying in bed alone, I thought about how quickly joy can tip into doubt."

I wanted to reach for his hand, but something in his posture — the slight fold of his arms — made me pause. We finished our drinks, and he walked me to my car, both of us careful, like we were carrying something fragile and weren't sure how to set it down."

We talked about ordinary things — bread, coffee beans — until I reached past her for a jar on the shelf. My hand brushed her arm, just for a second, and the contact sent a jolt through me. I wanted to keep it there. I didn't."

It wasn't an invitation, not exactly, but I'd half-hoped he would come by. I stared at the phone longer than I should have, wondering if he'd felt the same hesitation."

For a moment, the noise of the room faded, and all I could see was the way her smile softened when our eyes met.\n\n[Rose's thought, unspoken]\nIf this were the rest of my life, would that be enough? The answer came so fast it startled me.\n\nWe didn't cross the space between us, but I knew — and so did he — that we would. Eventually."

I called him instantly. \"Are we doing this, Brian? Or are we pretending it never mattered?\" There was a pause on the line, and then he said quietly, \"I'll be there.\""

I walked up, touched her arm lightly, and said, \"Can we talk?\" We stepped outside into the cool night air. The words spilled — about the missed moments, about not wanting to lose what we'd found. She looked at me, eyes shining. \"Then don't lose me.\""

When we finally pulled back, we were both breathing hard, foreheads pressed together. I wanted to tell him right then, I thought, but it wasn't time. Not yet."

    content: "When we stepped into her apartment, it was as if the weeks apart had never happened — except for the hunger in both of us that hadn't been there before. We kissed against the door, against the wall, making our way slowly toward the bedroom. Clothes fell away without urgency, replaced by hands, lips, and the quiet murmur of each other's names. We spent the morning wrapped together in her bed, sunlight drifting across the sheets as we rediscovered every part of each other… By evening, candles, wine, and another slow return to skin on skin. When we finally slept, our breathing was in sync. It felt less like a single encounter and more like a day-long conversation spoken entirely through touch."
